# Engineering Challenge
The view should have the following features:-

1. A search bar that allows users to search for books by title.
2. A list of search results that displays the book title, author, and a button to add the book to the students reading list.
3. A reading list that displays all the books that the teacher has added.
4. A button to remove a book from the reading list.

You can build this view without the concept of a "student" and just have a single reading list for the teacher.
